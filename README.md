This repository contains the visualization and statistical code for understanding the relationship between living 
hardship and accessibility to public transportation in the city of Chicago. 

We quantified these phenomena with a Hardship Index (calculated by the US Census), based on various socioeconomic factors,
and a Transit Score (calculated by WalkScore), based on proximity to various kinds of public transportation modes. 

Thus far, there does not appear to be any definitive relationship between the two measures. More research is required.
